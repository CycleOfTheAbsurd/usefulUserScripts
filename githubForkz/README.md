Adds a button beside "Fork", which opens a new tab to find <a href="https://github.com/techgaun/active-forks">"Active Forks"</a> and <a href="https://github.com/useful-forks/useful-forks.github.io">"Useful Forks"</a>, both websites which show cool derivatives of the current github repository you are viewing. 


Known Issues: This userscript might screw up with random buttons like "Sponsor". Let me know if it does.
